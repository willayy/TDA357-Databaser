R0(-departmentName-, departmentAbbreviation)

R2(-courseCode-, courseName, credits, capacity, departmentName)

R3(-studentIdnr-, studentName, login, programName, branchName)

R4(-studentIdnr-, courseCode, grade, position)

# Here we only have (studentIdnr, classification, courseCode) left in the 
# domain and we realise these are MVD’s so we decompose into 4NF

R5(-courseCode-, -classification-)

R6(-studentIdnr-, -courseCode-)

# At the end we are left with only one attribute which is a superkey to itself
