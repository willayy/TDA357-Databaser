D(studentIdnr,studentName,login,branchName,programName,programAbbreviation,courseCode,courseName,credits,departmentName,departmentAbbreviation,capacity,classification,grade,position)

FD's :

login → studentIdnr;

studentIdnr → studentName, login, programName, branchName;

departmentName → departmentAbbreviation;

courseCode → courseName, credits, capacity, departmentName;

courseCode, position → studentIdnr;

studentIdnr, courseCode → grade, position;

departAbbreviation → departmentName;

programName → programAbbreviation;

BCNF :

# -name- means its a primary key.
# The relatiopnships are created in chronoliogical order so departmentAbbreviation was eliminated first
# programAbbreviation was eliminated second etc...

D(studentIdnr,studentName,login,branchName,programName,programAbbreviation,courseCode,
courseName,credits,departmentName,departmentAbbreviation,capacity,classification,grade,position)

# Broken down into

R0(-departmentName-, departmentAbbreviation)

R1(-programName-, programAbbreviation)

R2(-courseCode-, courseName, credits, capacity, departmentName)

R3(-studentIdnr-, studentName, login, programName, branchName)

R4(-studentIdnr-, -courseCode-, grade, position)

# Here we only have (studentIdnr, classification, courseCode) left in the 
# domain and we realise these are three MVD’s so we decompose into 4NF
# The relations used are "Classified relation" "Registered relation"

R5(-courseCode-, -classification-) using courseCode →→ classification

R6(-studentIdnr-, -courseCode-) using studentIdnr →→ courseCode
