# TDA357-Databaser
Labs for the Chalmers course TDA-357/Databaser

### Table of content

#### Lab 1
This lab covers the basics of working with SQL in PostgreSQL. It contains some simple tables, views and an insert file that populates the tables with data. The tables originate from a Domain description given in the course. You can find this domain description in the domainDescription.txt file.

#### Lab 2
This lab builds on the first lab and improves the tables and adds some new ones. It also contains a ER-diagram that shows the relations between the tables. This lab also included doing functional decomposition of the relationships.

#### Lab 3
This lab builds on the previous labs and the focus of the lab was making trigger functions for the views.

#### Lab 4
This lab includes building a Java frontend that we connect tot the DBMS database. The frontend is a simple Web application that uses the JDBC driver to connect to the database.
